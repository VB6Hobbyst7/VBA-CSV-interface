# Dependencies
{: .fs-9 }

The library depends on the [ECPTextStream class]( https://github.com/ws-garcia/ECPTextStream) in order to work with text files. In the same way, the class uses two external class modules: one for configuration sharing and the other for data storage. All dependencies are written in pure VBA.
